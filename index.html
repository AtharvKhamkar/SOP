    <h1>Taj Mahal</h1>

    <p>
      <b>The Taj Mahal</b>

      is located on the right bank of the

      <u> Yamuna River in a vast Mughal garden </u>

      that encompasses nearly 17 hectares, in the Agra District in Uttar
      Pradesh. It was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife
      Mumtaz Mahal with construction starting in 1632 AD and completed in 1648
      AD, with the mosque, the guest house and the main gateway on the south,
      the outer courtyard and its cloisters were added subsequently and
      completed in 1653 AD. The existence of several historical and Quaranic
      inscriptions in Arabic script have facilitated setting the chronology of
      Taj Mahal. For its construction, masons, stone-cutters, inlayers, carvers,
      painters, calligraphers, dome builders and other artisans were
      requisitioned from the whole of the empire and also from the Central Asia
      and Iran. Ustad-Ahmad Lahori was the main architect of the Taj Mahal.
